# Processing Physics Simulator
3D Rigid Body Physics simulator using only [Processing](https://processing.org/)'s point() and line() functions. Uses Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) to render lines between two points, Scan Line to render polygons, normal calculation to determine faces to render in 3D space and Newtonian physics. Written in Java.

> One of the project's scenes, where one cube is affected by gravity (red) and the other is not (blue).

The program interface allows for real-time selection, positioning, rotation, scaling and acceleration of objects. In a [previous version](https://github.com/bryanoliveira/processing-physics-simulator/blob/fc899000baecf513cc3da4b38ab104cd4de260f7/Simulator/Projections.pde) it also supported selecting between Cavalier, Cabinet, Isometric, Perspective-Z and Perspective-XZ projections.

## Usage
- Clone this repository
- Install [Processing](https://processing.org/download/)
- Open this project with Processing IDE or execute `processing-java --sketch=Simulator --force --run` in a CLI.
