# Processing Physics Simulator
3D physics simulator using only [Processing](https://processing.org/)'s point() and line() functions. Uses Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) to render lines between two points, Scan Line to render polygons, normal calculation to determine faces to render in 3D space and Newtonian physics. Written in Java.
